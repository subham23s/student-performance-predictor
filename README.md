# Student Performance Predictor 🎓

A simple Machine Learning project that predicts a student's final exam score based on:

- Hours Studied
- Attendance Percentage
- Previous Exam Score

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict final scores using structured student performance data.

The workflow includes:
- Data loading
- Feature selection
- Train-test split
- Model training
- Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error
